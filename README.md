-- ASCII ART CONVERTER --

This is a simple Python script that turns any image into an ASCII art. It resizes, converts it to grayscale, and then maps each pixel's brightness to a character so you get a text version of the image that you used.

- What do you need:. Python 3 and Pillow library

- How to use it:. Put the image that you want to convert in the same folder as the script and name it input_image (using .png) and then run the script. It will generate an .txt file in the same folder with your ASCII art.
